# SimpleBank

The service that weâ€™re going to build is a simple bank. It will provide APIs for the frontend to do following things:

- Creating Bank Accounts and can Manage the same bank accounts.
- Recording all the transfers in the accounts So every time some money is added to or subtracted from the account, 
  an account entry record will be created.
- perform a money transfer between 2 accounts. This will be happening within a transaction, 
  so that either both account balance should be updated or none of them  are.
